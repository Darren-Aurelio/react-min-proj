The main library I used in this project is React.js. It is completely flexible for me to use this as it is one of its benefits. By react js, I can have external libraries such as yup, react-router-dom, formik, and many more. Tools could be also used as react.js allows them. Using this library will ensure you that the app performance which you have will be optimized.
External Libraries: (based on google):
React Router DOM, enables you to implement dynamic routing in a web app.
Axios, which is a popular library is mainly used to send asynchronous HTTP requests to REST endpoints.
Formik, a small group of React components and hooks for building forms in React and React Native.
Yup, a JavaScript schema builder for value parsing and validation.
Reactstrap, It provides inbuilt Bootstrap components that make it easy to create UI with self-contained components that provide flexibility and inbuilt validations.
React-Bootstrap is a component-based library that provides native Bootstrap components as pure React components.

I've made a style for the login and register page (same design, and was referred from a guy in youtube), it is pretty simple and basic. Other then that, nothing much was added on. (dashboard a little).
